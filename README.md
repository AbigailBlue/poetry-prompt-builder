Generate sophisticated prompts that produce better AI poetry
Learn the basics of poetic craft along the way

Example Output
Instead of: "Write me a poem about my grandmother"
You get: "Write a villanelle about grandmother's garden using these specific details: the smell of tomatoes, her worn gardening gloves, how she hummed while weeding... A villanelle has 19 lines with two refrains that repeat according to the pattern ABA ABA ABA ABA ABA ABAA. The repetition should capture how these memories cycle back and consume our minds..."

Philosophy
Poetry isn't about following rules‚Äîit's about choosing the right tool for your purpose. A hammer works great for nails, but you need a screwdriver for screws. Similarly, different poetic forms serve different emotional and artistic purposes.
This app helps users discover which "tool" (form) works best for what they want to express, then guides them in using it effectively with AI assistance.

Acknowledgments
Inspired by poets and educators who believe that understanding craft enhances rather than limits creative expression. Special thanks to the tradition of ars poetica‚Äîpoems about poetry itself.

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for anyone who's ever wanted to write a better poem
